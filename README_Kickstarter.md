# Kickstarting with Excel
Kickstarter Campaign Analysis

## Overview of Project
Breakdown of the Kickstarter Campaigns to understand what is most Successful or Unsuccessful

### Purpose
To understand pivotTables and functions in excel as well as finding the most successful Theater/Play Kickstarters and seeing what makes them work
## Analysis and Challenges
There are many functions to assist in creating spreadsheets/PivotTables. The functions can get ellaborate and complicated, but you can find assistance from the web on sites like https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/search

Many Categories of Kickstarters don't have any that were successful. The theater category had the most successful and profitable kickstarters making them a better focus for success in the future.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

During the months of April to May there is a spike in successful Theater with a slow decline to December.
A majority of Theater Kickstarters are successful (839 out of 1,369)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The chances of a successful play meeting their goals are steady around 60-80% at <$25000 and become unpredictable when the goal is >$25000 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
It's easy for me to understand the breakdown of what I want to accomplish and what the outcome should be, but the formula's don't come naturally yet so it has been a steady learning process and has really challenged my skill level.

## Results

# What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theater is most profitable in May and least in December. The failed Theater's follow a similar pattern over the months as the profitable one's. They just didn't have enough funding.

# What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
There were no cancelled Plays in the Theater category but 34% failed. Success rate of 66% for Plays and 13% had a goal of $50,000+. That 13% would be considered outliers and would skew our results. The majority of successful plays have a goal of $20,000 to $24,999 or $1,000-$4,999. 

# What are some limitations of this dataset?
The outliers skewing the Kickstarter data is limiting our chances of getting a good breakdown of the Mode for certain category data. This has made it harder to compare category types against eachother since they are wildly different.

# What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A table showing how many people pledged and the average amount they pledged towards certain Categories. A graph to show what categories had the least and most success
